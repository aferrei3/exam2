1. mips registers typically have a register and a number because they different letters on the registers correspond to how they are used and the numbers represent how many of them exist for that particular function.

2. The a registers are used to pass functions to a subroutine

3. The s registers are saved on the stack

4. 
	a. add adds two registers together while addi adds an immediate value or constant to the register.
	b. a pseudo instruction in mips is an instruction is an instruction that is really more than one instructions similar to using a library in c 
	c. an assembly directive tells the assembler how to interpret the following data. for example the .text assembly directive lets the program know that its a program, while the .asciiz lets the assembler know that an ascii string is coming up.

5.

.text
.globl main
main:
	li $s0,1
	li $s1, 1
	bne $s1, $s0, ELSE
	li $s3, 1
ELSE:	add $s2, $s0, $s1

6.

.text
.globl main
main:
	li $s1,1
	li $s2, 5
	bgt $s2, $s1, IFG
IFG:	li $s1, 0xF

7.
.data
	prompt .asciiz "DONE WITH MIPS!"
.text
bar: 
	la $t0, $s0
	andi $t0, 2
	bneq $t0, 10, NEQ
	addi $t0, 10
NEQ:	li $t1, 0
	la $s0, $t0

main:
	li $s0, 8
	jal bar
	li $v0, 4
	la $a0, prompt
	syscall
